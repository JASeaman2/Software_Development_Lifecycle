How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
-Well when hearing a user needs for a program I listen to what they repeat and what they want to see in the program that will make the happy. Creating a user story helps so I can break down their needs so I can make a backlog of what they want and what I can test later. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
-My approach to developing a program goes, what do I want the final outcome to be and then what each feature needs to make the final product possible. I hope to incorporate the use of a backlog so I can see what everything is needed to get done and then start doing each task from it. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
-To me a good team member needs excellent communication skills, have some knowledge of programming, and is flexible or fluid with tasks.
